### üèñÔ∏è Concept

Oavel is a participative platform to report pollutions on all coastline beaches. For the moment, only spots in Bretagne area in France are available. This project is in development.

With Oavel, you can be informed about the state of the coast, be made aware of the quality of spots, beaches, and alert about pollution, whether visual, formal, and in real time.
Today 3 parameters come into play in the overall quality of a spot: the quality of the water, the presence of pollutants (plastics), the presence of animals in danger.

The site is updated in real time. When alerts are sent then they are processed by our reliability algorithms and then the spot is updated with its latest status.

### üì¢ Motivational

Sensitive to the quality of water and the environment, Oavel's identity comes mainly from a desire to protect and share.
Today too few people are informed about the state of the beaches. Political and scientific actors do not take into account the real time aspect. It is still too difficult to be well informed and only participatory communities like Oavel can fill this gap.

Oavel also allows you to archive track states over time. Keeping track of what is happening is also a priority.

### How this project is built

Oavel is a project that aims to be open source, collaborative, educational, and scalable.

A few criteria were required in the design:

- ‚ôªÔ∏è Digital eco-design: create a low-impact digital tool
- üßë‚Äçüè´ Educational aim: display information to raise awareness, educate and promote coastal protection
- ü§ù Participative: allow anyone who wishes to contribute to the project, whether in terms of code, scientific part, communication or content

From a technical point of view, this project uses React as a front-end library, Material UI for display components, and Firebase for site and data hosting. Every new feature is pushed to Git and a CI has been put in place. This project is regularly tested, in particular via unit tests.
Particular attention has been paid to the UI/UX, with the aim of making the application simple and light on the eye.

Thank you for your attention to Oavel and welcome!
